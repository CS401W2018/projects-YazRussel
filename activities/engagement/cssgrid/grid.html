                    <li>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex? <br>
                    Flex works bit differently, when do you choose grid and flex. The parent determine the size of the child, while flex the children gets to be the size and the parents says okay I'll let you to be that size. Two dimensional for grid, and flex is one dimensional and can be two dimensional.
