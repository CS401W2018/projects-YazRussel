    <h1> Engagement - <dfn>OL, UL</dfn></h1>
    <p>Here is a list of questions that you need to answer on the web page you created today.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the best way to make sure you get a good grade on the projects?</li>
        <blockquote>
            The best way to get a better grade is to study in advance, and also keep on checking Canvas 
            to be aware of the upcoming quizzes, activites, and projects. Contunuing with this kind of attitude 
            will reduce the stress, feel motivated, and have more time to work on themselves.</blockquote>
        <li>When is your project due</li>
        <blockquote>
            The project is due on Monday.
        </blockquote>
        <li>What are special entity characters?</li>
        <blockquote>
            Special entity characters usually starts with <kbn>"&"</kbn> and ends with <kbn>";". 
            These are necessary to represent a character that are special functions for HTML which 
            cannot be typed easily when coding.</kbn>
            One of the example that Brother Slade gave during the discussion are:
            <ul>
                <li> &amp;lt - this helps you produce or type&nbsp;<kbn>"&lt;"</kbn>&nbsp;</li>
                <li> &amp;nbsp</li> - this is the opposite of &lt;br&gt;
                <li> &amp;gt</li> - this helps you produce or type&nbsp;<kbn>"&gt;"</kbn>
                <li> &amp;copy</li> - this helps you produce or type &copy;
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <li>What is the difference between OL and UL tags?</li>
        <blockquote>
            Though they have the same purpose of making list, they still have difference in use. &lt;ul&gt; is used for having a sequence of items that doesn't have to sort it out accordingly. While &lt;ol&gt; display a list in order to show the sequence, usually numerically.
