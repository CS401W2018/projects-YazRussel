    <h2> Engagement Assignment</h2>
    <p>We will discuss the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Structuural Tags (HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;header&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;nav&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;main&gt;</li>
                <li>&lt;footer&gt;</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What goes in the header?</li>
            <blockquote>The header tag is on the top part of every web. It will and should stay the same on every page. </blockquote>
        <li>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? 
            Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</li>
            <blockquote>
                Yes, navigation can go to the header, but not necessarily. They are doing AB testing, to find what web layout does the user visit more.
                The navigation, has a design when the cursor point or click the navigation. 
                <br>The navigation usually have a link connected to it.
                The link will direct you to a different webpage when clicked.
            </blockquote>
        <li>What goes in Main?</li>
            <blockquote>
                Where's you main content goes into. Main tag will change when you go to a different navigation. 
                What does this webpage is all about
            </blockquote>
        <li>What goes in the Footer?</li>
            <blockquote>
                What they usually put in the footer is the copyright, privacy notice (a policy that a user should follow), leagal notices, cookies (this collects data), and some useful links.
                It is just like header, it doesn't change. However, it is on the bottom of every page.
            </blockquote>
        <li>HTML Validation</li>
            <blockquote>
                There is a right way to do HTML, and you can make some mistakes. HTML never crashes, but there will be some problem when you view it.
                We never wanted our webpage looks different as what we perceive it should be, so what we can do is use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator Service</a>
                to check you HTML code and locate the error. 
            </blockquote>
