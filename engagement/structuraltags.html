    <p>We will discuss the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structuural Tags (HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER)</li>
        <li>What goes in the header?</li>
            <blockquote>The header tag is on the top part of every web. It will and should stay the same on every page. </blockquote>
        <li>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? 
            Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</li>
            <blockquote>
                Yes, navigation can go to the header, but not necessarily. They are doing AB testing, to find what web layout does the user visit more.
                The navigation, has a design when the cursor point or click the navigation. The navigation usually have a link connected to it.
                The link will direct you to a different webpage when clicked.
            </blockquote>
        <li>What goes in Main?</li>
            <blockquote>
                Where's you main content goes into. Main tag will change when you go to a different navigation. 
            </blockquote>
        <li>What goes in the Footer?</li>
            <blockquote>
                What they usually put in the footer is the copyright, privacy notice (a policy that a user should follow), leagal notices, cookies (this collects data), and some useful links.
