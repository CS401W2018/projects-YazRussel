            <h2>Serve as a full-time missionary</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                From October 2018 to 2020, I had the privilege of serving on a mission in the Philippines Cabanatuan Mission, located about five hours from my hometown. Those two years stand out as some of the happiest and most transformative days of my life. Guided by the exemplary leadership of President and Sister Nobleza, I embraced the mission's purpose wholeheartedly—to serve and uplift others while seeing them through the eyes of divine grace.
                <br>
                <br>
                During this time, I deepened my understanding that the ways of the Lord are far superior to the ways of the world. My faith was strengthened daily as I immersed myself in the sacred scriptures, sought forgiveness for my sins, renewed my covenant with Him each Sunday through the sacrament, and strived to endure to the end with steadfast faith.
                <br>
                <br>
                My days as a missionary were filled with learning, personal growth, and countless interactions that deeply enriched my faith and understanding of service. This journey wasn't just about the tasks I performed but the lives we touched and the communal spirit of love and service we fostered together. This photo was taken during my last day of my mission server which captures a bittersweet moment—celebrating the completion of my service, yet feeling the poignant farewell to a cherished chapter.
                <br>
                <br>
                I carry forward the invaluable lessons learned and the miracles witnessed, which continue to shape me into a better version of myself. I am eternally grateful for the experiences that have crafted deep-seated resilience and a lasting commitment to serving others.

            <h2>Hiking as my hobby to relieve stress</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                I started hiking in high school. However, there aren’t many good spots around our city since it’s an urban area; the nearest mountain for hiking is an hour or two away. My first hike was to Callao Cave, where we trekked for two hours to see the cave and the river beside it. It was a great experience for a beginner.

                In this photo, I am at Laie Falls, located in Laie, Hawaii, not too far from Brigham Young University-Hawaii, where I attend university. On the way to this spot, you pass through pine trees, then dome-shaped hills, and as you go further, the view opens up dramatically.
                <br>
                <br>
                I often hike to find peace in nature and to feel joy within myself, where I can be myself and just have fun. I always make time to balance my lifestyle, especially as a computer science student. Contrary to the stereotype that we are introverts who prefer staying indoors, I am someone who enjoys being outdoors and engaging in adventurous activities such as hiking, swimming, and traveling, where I can meet other people.
