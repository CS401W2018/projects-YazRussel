    <ol>
        <li>The title and topic of your site.
            <br>
            Personal Portfolio
        </li>
        <li>A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.
            <br>
            I once aspired to have my own website, however, I have no idea where to start. And to think of it, the best fit for this project is something that I fully understand and that is myself. Subsequently, I will be needing this kind of portfolio, especially as a Computer Science student who are trying to rank myself with other great programmers. I have been to lazy to start this kind of project since I myself is not a good designer. I thought that before taking this class, it would be nice to take some UI/UX design class first to enhance my creativity. But I guess for this project I’ll just work on it and use other people’s opinions about the portfolio that I will be making. 
        </li>
        <li>List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).
            <br>
            The list of contents that I will be including for this project is mainly the homepage, skill and projects, resume, about me, contact me, FAQ or Future Goals.
        </li>
        <li>What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?
            <br>
            What I can put in my table is my skill table or classes which I have taken already or my learning tracker table.
        </li>
        <li>How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.
            <br>
            I will take a photo of myself. I will also include my LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram on my website portfolio. I might also take some quotes from the general conferences.
        </li>
        <li>Include a statement acknowledging that you have read the warnings below.
            <br>
            I do acknowledge that I can copy and paste a text from Wikipedia, will not use any copyrighted pictures, and will not copy any design from other sites and other students, and will not use CHATGPT.
