            I started watching his game to improve my gameplay, as I also noticed that he is always calm and
            reserve whenever he play. He serve as an assistant to the captain in his team, where he is in charge
            of map awareness or giving intel to his team. He is great at roaming around in the enemies jungle and
            that gives his team a great advantage.
