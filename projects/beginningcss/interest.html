            This is a hobby I&apos;ve played for a few years now. It&apos;s a mobile game that allows you to interact 
            with other players and plan strategies to defeat the opposing team. It all started two years after 
            I returned from my mission. I noticed that my nephews and younger brother were always playing this 
            game, and they would even invite me to join, but I always said no. Eventually, I noticed they were 
            developing bad habits from playing, such as frustration, poor manners, and even trash talking. I was 
            disappointed, so I told them to stop playing, but it was too lateâ€”they were already addicted.
        </p>
        <p class="font"> 
            So, I decided to start playing the game myself to better understand how I could help them. I taught 
            them how to keep their composure when they were angry, how to communicate effectively with their team, 
            how to appreciate their teammates when they did something right, and, most importantly, that the game is 
            meant for entertainment and should not define their lives. 
        </p>
        <p class="font">
            Overall, I enjoy this game because of my family. It&apos;s my way of bonding with my younger brother and nephews, 
            while also using a modern approach to teach them good manners. <span>I continue to play this game to relieve stress 
            and make new friends online.</span>

            A <strong>relative link</strong> is helps locate a resource you have in your folder that you want to show
            in your current page by clicking the link. This makes everything easier to copy the content of that web page
            to your current web page. While <strong>absolute link</strong> has to put the exact location of the web by 
            including the complete URL of the web page. This is mainly used when you are trying to send the user to a
            different domain.
