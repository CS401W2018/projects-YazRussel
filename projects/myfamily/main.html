                    <h2>Jay</h2>
                    <p>Jay Pritchett is a pragmatic, no-nonsense businessman with a dry sense of humor and a sometimes gruff exterior. Though initially set in his ways, he grows more open-minded and sentimental over time, especially through his relationship with Gloria and their young son, Joe. Despite his tough front, Jay deeply cares for his family and often shows a softer, protective side when it matters most.</p>

                    <p>Manny Delgado is a mature, romantic, and artistic young man with a deep love for poetry, culture, and the finer things in life. Unlike typical kids his age, he’s sensitive, thoughtful, and often wise beyond his years, which can make him seem eccentric but endearing.
