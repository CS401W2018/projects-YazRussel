            Suyou is the last in a long line of mystical exorcists wielding the power of the ancient Immortal Nuo. By day, he's like a chill superhero, roaming around and soaking in the sights and sounds of Zhu'an, a bustling city. At night, he transforms, watching over the city from high rooftops, always ready to combat dark forces using the mighty powers granted by the faith of the people.

        <p>
            One night, Suyou remembers how a powerful exorcist saved him from evil forces called echoes of malice. This memory shows him how important it is to keep hope and faith alive to protect against darkness. Years later, he finds his rescuer in a small town, fighting alone to keep these evil forces away from the townspeople who don't realize the danger they're in. At first, Suyou tries to tell everyone the truth, but he quickly sees that this only makes their fear stronger, which makes the dark forces stronger too. He realizes that his hero had been lying to keep the town calm.</p>
        <p>
            Suyou then takes over, wearing the sacred mask and holding the exorcist blade that was given to him. He starts performing the ancient rituals that boost the townspeople's spirits and turn their shared faith into a real power that pushes away the evil. As Suyou moves from one place to another, he strengthens people's faith and fights against dark forces. In doing this, he really shows what it means to be an Exorcist of Nuo.
