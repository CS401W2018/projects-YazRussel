    <h1> Mabuhay! My name is Yaz Russel Darasin</h1>
    <p>
        I am from the Philippines, in the northern part of Luzon Island, which is known for its hot and humid weather. 
        I grew up with loving parents who are great cooks, and I'm glad I inherited their cooking skillsâ€”it would have 
        been a bummer if I hadn't. The first dishes I made as a kid were Filipino-style spaghetti and spring rolls. I 
        started cooking at a young age because I hated the scorching afternoon heat from the sun. So, every afternoon instead
        of playing outside with my friends, I would rather ask my mother to teach me to cook. 
    </p>
    <p>
         Here is the guide for preparing classic Filipino dishes that I adored
         during my childhood! Whether you're drawn to the tangy delight of <em>sinigang</em>, the 
         comforting feeling that <em>tinola</em> brings, or the savory taste of <em>dinakdakan</em>, 
         this page is meant to help you. It's perfect for beginners, helping to give a simple and detailed instructions 
         to easily master these recipes. However, for now I will teach you how to cook <q>sinigang na baboy</q> or pork stew.  
         I intended to do this so I could share my favorite dish and help you dive into the rich culinary traditions of the Philippines and recreate the flavors of home in your kitchen!

    <h3> Favorite Filipino Foods:</h3>
    <ol type="A">
        <li> <strong>Sinigang</strong> (Sour and Savory Stew)</li>
        <li> <strong>Tinola</strong> (Filipino Chicken Soup)</li>
        <li> <strong>Dinakdakan</strong> (Grilled Pork)</li>
        <li> <strong>Pancit Batil Patong</strong> (Fried Noodles with Various Toppings)</li>

    </ol>
    <h2> Sinigang</h2>
    <blockquote> 
        The recipe for ultimate comfort food is sinigang na baboy! Hearty and tasty on 
        its own or eaten with steamed rice, it's made with pork ribs, veggies, and a broth flavored with tamarind. 
        This dish is a comforting choice for cold weather, which reminds me of when I was a kid who loved playing 
        in the rain and coming home to a warm meal despite the unceasing scolding for catching a cold.
        The fun part about this dish is there will always be leftover, where you can reheat it again in&nbsp;150&deg;&nbsp;F
        anytime you want and feast with yourself.
