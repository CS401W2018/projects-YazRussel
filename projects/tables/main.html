                        The table presents characters from the game Grand Chase, detailing each character's background and associated land or region. It includes their origins, motivations for embarking on their respective journeys, and key characteristics defining their roles in the game's narrative. In the story's universe, the Creator God initially formed other gods to manage the creation of the universe, and to balance this, He also created demonic tribes tasked with overseeing destruction when needed. Due to the "evil" nature of the magical energy of these tribes, they were segregated into a separate magical dimension called Elyos, instead of the material world with the other gods. When necessary, these tribes access the material world through Dimensional Portals to carry out destruction.
